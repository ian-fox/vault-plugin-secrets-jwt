This was originally a toy project made to learn about vault, a more fully-featured and updated version is at https://github.com/outfoxx/vault-plugin-secrets-jwt/

This is a standalone backend plugin for use with [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.github.com/hashicorp/vault).
This plugin provides the ability to sign [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io) (JWTs) without ever having the signing keys leave Vault.

It is still under early development and should not be used anywhere.

**Please note**: Hashicorp take Vault's security and their users' trust very seriously. If you believe you have found a security issue in Vault, _please responsibly disclose_ by contacting them at [security@hashicorp.com](mailto:security@hashicorp.com).
